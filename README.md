# LibGDXAtlasForUnity

## Description
This repository is a port of LibGDXAtlas (importer originally made for Monogame) to Unity.
It reads texture atlas files generated by [LibGDX texture packer](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Texture-packer) command line program. When importing into Unity first import the texture atlas image (.png) file. Let Unity import it then copy the atlas file (.atlas). It will convert the image file into a multisprite resource and apply correct slicing. It will also generate a Prefab, animation controller, and animation sequence foreach animation* in the atlas.

Note: An animation are sections with the same name and a sequence of indexes. Individual frames have -1 for index and unique names.

## Project Setup
When compiling the project update the references for UnityEngine DLLs to your directory **%PROGRAMFILES%\Unity\Editor\Data\Managed\UnityEngine**.

So
"%PROGRAMFILES%\Unity\Editor\Data\Managed\UnityEngine"
usually will become
"C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Data\Managed\UnityEngine"

## Future work
* Combine the LibGDXAtlas.Model and LibGDXAtlasParser projects.
* Generate project that combines all three DLLs as a single DLL.
